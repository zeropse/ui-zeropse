      question: "What is Curated UI and who is it for?",
      answer:
        "Curated UI is a meticulously curated directory of modern UI components, libraries, design systems, and web tools. It is built for developers and designers who want to stop endlessly bookmarking scattered resources and start building exceptional products faster.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you select the libraries that get listed?",
      answer:
        "We have strict curation standards. Every resource is manually tested to ensure it meets modern design aesthetics, has good documentation, is actively maintained, and provides genuine value to the web development community.",
    },
    {
      question: "How can I submit a new site?",
      answer:
        "We welcome community submissions. To submit a new site, please open an issue on our GitHub repository and ensure that your submission meets our quality guidelines. Each submission is thoroughly reviewed before being added to the directory.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this directory free to use?",
      answer:
        "Yes, Curated UI is completely free and open-source. We believe in keeping high-quality design resources accessible to everyone.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often do you add new resources?",
      answer:
        "We update the directory on a weekly basis, adding newly discovered gems and reviewing community submissions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you rank or sponsor specific libraries?",
      answer:
        "No. All resources are curated based on merit and quality. We do not accept paid placements yet to ensure the integrity of our curation.",
